Image Guessing game created to gather image metadata for the British Library

The British library have scanned a large collection of public domain images. Presently they know nothing about them except what book they are in and what page they are on.
This game was created to learn more about what these images represent. When you guess an image we measure how easy it was for you and this helps us learn whether that word is a good match for those images.
When you create a game we can present that game to other players to gather even more data.
